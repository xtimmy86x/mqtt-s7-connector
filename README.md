# mqtt-s7-connector
This is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) tool to connect a Siemens S7 PLC over Mqtt with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant)

This project is intended to use along with [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant), but is also possible to use it as a simple bridge between s7 and mqtt.


## Purpose
This tool can receive data over mqtt and can write it to a designated address on a plc and vice versa, enabling smart home data to be displayed in the home assistant.


## How to install

```
docker run -d -v /path/on/host/config.json:/usr/src/app/config.json timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector
```
Note: You only have to mount the configuration file, not the entire folder.  
Config volume mountpoint: ```/usr/src/app/config.json```

## Config File

The configuration file has to be located in the same directory as the installation and has to be named ```config.json```  


__An example of a correct configuration file is found in [```config.example.json```](https://github.com/timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector/blob/master/config.example.json).__

The config file has to be valid JSON (You can check [here](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) if it´s correct)
and may include optional top-level settings such as:

* `retain_messages` - publish MQTT updates with the retain flag (`false` by default)

It is separated in 3 sections:

* plc:  
> __general setup of the connection to the plc__  
>
> In the most use cases you only have to change the host value to the correct ip
>
```
"plc": {
    "port": 102,
    "host": "192.168.0.1",
    "rack": 0,
    "slot": 2,
    "debug": false
}
```

* mqtt:  
> __general setup of the connection to the mqtt broker__
>
>The URL/host value can be one of the following protocols: 'mqtt', 'mqtts', 'tcp', 'tls', 'ws', 'wss'.
>
>If you are using a self-signed certificate, use the ```rejectUnauthorized: false``` option. Beware that you are exposing yourself to man in the middle attacks, so it is a configuration that is not recommended for production environments.
>

```
"mqtt": {
    "host": "mqtts://host.com:1234",
    "user": "u",
    "password": "p",
    "rejectUnauthorized": true
}
```

* devices:
> __list of all registered devices__
>
> the list of devices is implemented as an array in json.  
> each device has it's own entry in this list and will be configured there.  
>
> Each device has to have a 'name' entry and a 'type' entry, the remaining attributes are optional
>
```
"devices": [
      {
          "name": "Dimmable Light",
          "type": "light",

          "state": "DB56,X150.0",
          "brightness": "DB56,BYTE151"
      },
      {
          "name": "Dimmable Light 2",
          "type": "light",

          "state": "DB56,X150.1",
      }
]
```



## Address formatting
This tool uses the NodeS7 Library and it uses the same address formatting.  
An example of correct formatted addresses is found at the [NodeS7 Repository](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7#examples)

__Address examples:__  
DB56,X150.0 _(read from DB56 one bit at 150.0)_  
DB51,REAL216 _(read from DB51 four bytes starting from byte 216)_  
DB56,BYTE40 _(read from DB56 one byte at 40)_  

__Supported data types__  
X = 1 Bit -> converted to true / false  
BYTE = 1 Byte (8 Bit) -> converted to Int  
REAL = 4 Bytes (32 Bit) -> converted to Float  

For more information see the [NodeS7 Repository](https://github.com/plcpeople/nodeS7#examples)





## Device types and attributes
The device type categories are based on the categories from Home Assistant  
__It is strongly recommended to look into the [example configuration file](https://github.com/timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector/blob/master/config.example.json) !!__


Current list of supported device types with supported attributes:

* light
  * ```state``` _(X)_  
  on/off state of the device

  * ```brightness``` _(BYTE)_  
  value between 0-255


* sensor  
  * ```state``` _(X/BYTE/REAL)_  
  state of device  
  _is readonly by default_


* switch
  * ```state``` _(X)_  
  on/off state of the device


* climate
  * ```target_temperature``` _(REAL)_  

  * ```current_temperature``` _(REAL)_  
  _readonly by default_  
  _update_interval is 15 min by default_  


* cover
  * ```targetPosition``` _(BYTE)_  

  * ```tiltAngle``` _(BYTE)_  

  * ```currentPosition``` _(BYTE)_  
  _readonly by default_  

  * ```currentTiltAngle``` _(BYTE)_  
  _readonly by default_  

  * ```trigger``` _(X)_  
  __internal value__: it won't be exposed over mqtt  
  this bit will be turned on and off automatically after one of the other attributes of the cover will be changed


* binaryCover
  * ```targetPosition``` _(X)_  

  * ```currentPosition``` _(X)_  
  _readonly by default_  


## Attribute Options

A "simple" device has just the plc address as the value of the attributes,  
however it's possible to configure each attribute individually by assigning an object instead of a string to it.


Simple Attribute:
```
...

"state": "DB56,X150.0",

...
```

Rewritten Attribute:
```
...

"state": {
  "plc": "DB56,X150.0"
},

...
```

Now after rewriting it's possible to add more options inside the brackets of the attribute.

__Available options:__

* rw
> Changes the read / write permissions  

|    | Read PLC | Write PLC | Subscribe MQTT | Publish MQTT |
|----|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| r  | ✅       | ❌        | ❌            | ✅            |
| w  | ❌       | ✅        | ✅            | ❌            |
| rw | ✅       | ✅        | ✅            | ✅            |

```
"state": {
    "plc": "DB56,X150.0",
    "rw": "r"
},
```

* update_interval
> By default (without this option) each attribute will sent an update over mqtt after it changes, but this option will disable it and set an interval for updates.  
> The time is set in ms
>
```
"state": {
    "plc": "DB56,BYTE234",
    "update_interval": 1000
},
```

* unit_of_measurement
> This is only for Home Assistant. It will add an additional unit of measurement to the data.
>
```
"state": {
    "plc": "DB56,REAL10",
    "unit_of_measurement": "km/h"
},
```

* set_plc
> By default attributes have only one address, but if you define "set_plc"  
> the attribute will read from "plc" and write to "set_plc"  
>
```
"state": {
    "plc": "DB56,X150.0",
    "set_plc": "DB56,X150.1"
},
```

* write_back
> When using both `plc_address` and `plc_set_address`, setting `write_back` to `true`
> will automatically write any changes read from `plc_address` to `plc_set_address`.
>
```
"state": {
    "plc": "DB56,X150.0",
    "set_plc": "DB56,X150.1",
    "write_back": true
},
```

## Auto Discovery
This tool will send for each device an auto-discovery message over mqtt in the correct format defined by Home Assistant.  

The default mqtt topic is ```homeassistant```, it can be changed in the config file. (See the [example](https://github.com/timroemisch/mqtt-s7-connector/blob/master/config.example.json#L10))


## ToDo
* climate component additional attributes
